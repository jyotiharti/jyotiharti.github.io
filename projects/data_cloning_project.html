            <h1>Riding the Data Train: How I Cloned the Hackathon Winners</h1>
            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                This was my first project cloning a Power BI dashboard, and I found it really exciting to replicate because of its detailed design. I took on this project to test my current knowledge of Power BI and see where I stand. Along the way, I gained valuable insights into templates and company-specific formatting that will be useful for my future work.</p>

            <h2>Objective:</h2>
            <p>My objective is to strengthen my expertise in Power BI by replicating detailed dashboards that reflect real-world applications. This process will help me improve my understanding of professional templates, design standards, and prepare for future opportunities to create impactful dashboards.</p>

                    <p><b>Overview: </b> The cloning project was about replicating a detailed Power BI dashboard to improve my skills in dashboard creation and data visualization. I worked on recreating every part of the dashboard, which helped me understand how templates and layouts are used in professional projects. This project gave me hands-on experience in designing user-friendly dashboards that provide clear and meaningful insights. Almost 80% of the cloning is complete, but some charts were difficult to replicate as I am still learning and improving my knowledge of Power BI. It also allowed me to test my current understanding of Power BI and identify areas where I can improve. I learned how to work with different features of Power BI, like formatting, layouts, and visualization tools. The project helped me understand the importance of professional standards and how to follow them when building dashboards. It also gave me a better idea of the types of designs and formats used in real-world scenarios. Overall, this project was a great learning experience that strengthened my skills and prepared me for future work in Power BI.</p>
